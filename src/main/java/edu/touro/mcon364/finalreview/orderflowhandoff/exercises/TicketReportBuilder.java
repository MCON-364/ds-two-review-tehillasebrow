/**
 * Building a report from completed work.
 *
 * A support system stores tickets after they have been submitted and worked on.
 * Each ticket has information such as its category, priority, whether it was
 * resolved, and how many minutes it took to resolve.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to turn a list of individual tickets into one
 * summary report. We are not modifying tickets. We are looking across the
 * collection and answering questions about the data.
 * -
 * - The tickets are already available as a collection.
 * - The job is to analyze the collection and produce answers.
 *
 * Before coding, think about the problem in two layers:
 *
 * Layer 1 — What data does this object need?
 * - Should the list of tickets be passed into every method?
 * - Or does it make sense for the builder to receive the list once and then
 *   answer several report questions about that same list?
 * - If this class stores the list, should it keep the original reference or
 *   protect itself with a copy?
 *
 * Layer 2 — What questions does the report ask?
 * - Which questions produce a single number?
 * - Which questions produce a map?
 * - Which questions produce a smaller list?
 * - Which questions require looking only at resolved tickets?
 * - Which questions require looking only at unresolved tickets?
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The constructor receives the tickets to analyze.
 * - The original list must not be modified by this class.
 * - getResolvedCount() returns how many tickets have been resolved.
 * - getAverageResolutionMinutes() returns the average resolution time for
 *   resolved tickets only.
 * - getCountByCategory() returns how many tickets belong to each category.
 * - getHighPriorityUnresolved() returns unresolved tickets that should receive
 *   the most urgent attention.
 * - buildReport() combines the answers from the smaller methods into one
 *   TicketReport object.
 * - Use streams to express the data processing logic.
 * - Do not use loops.
 *
 * Edge cases to think about:
 * - What should the constructor do if the provided list is null?
 * - What should the average be if there are no resolved tickets?
 * - What should the category-count map look like if the ticket list is empty?
 * - Should callers be able to modify the list returned by
 *   getHighPriorityUnresolved()?
 * - Should callers be able to modify the map returned by getCountByCategory()?
